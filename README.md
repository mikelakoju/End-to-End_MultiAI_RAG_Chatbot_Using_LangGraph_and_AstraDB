# 📚 **End-to-End Multi-AI RAG Chatbot Using LangGraph and AstraDB**
## Author: Dr Mike Lakoju

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using **LangGraph** and **AstraDB**. The chatbot integrates multiple AI capabilities to deliver intelligent responses by leveraging vector databases and advanced embeddings.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **LangGraph**: For graph-based conversational workflows.
- **AstraDB**: As the Vector Database for storing and querying embeddings.
- **HuggingFaceEmbeddings**: For document embedding transformations.
- **Python**: Backend scripting and data manipulation.

## 📦 **Setup and Installation**
1. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Set up your environment variables.

## 📊 **Key Steps**
1. **Data Retrieval:** Read data from web sources.
2. **Data Processing:** Split documents and convert them into embeddings using HuggingFace models.
3. **Store in AstraDB:** Load embeddings into the vector database for efficient querying.
4. **Conversational Flow:** Build and optimize conversational workflows with LangGraph.

## 🧠 **Core Functionality**
- Real-time query matching using embeddings.
- Enhanced contextual understanding.
- Scalable chatbot architecture.

## 🚦 **How to Run**
1. Open the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook End_to_End_Multi_AI_RAG_Chatbot_Using_LangGraph_and_AstraDB.ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the instructions in each cell to process the workflow.
